# Dirk1980ac's little script collection

This is my little script collection.  
Some are derived from scripts I found on the Internet and some others are
completely self-made.  
  
This Repository will grow over time. I'll add more scripts as soll as they get
into my hands.  
I didn't collect all the scripts I wrote in a central point until now.

## The Scripts

- bootc-genimage: Generate disk/installer images for bootc systems.

- firewalld-export: Export firewall rules to a file.

- gen-ula: Generates a random ULA for private IPv6 Networks.

- media-convert: Convert media files into different formats.

- rpm-crossbuild; Cross-build RPM packages for different architectures.

- video-convert: Convert videos into different formats.

- gpg-*: GPG related utilities to maintain the keyrings.
